# CreateFromAnalyticFunction
Create database curves or surfaces, even connectors, using a simple analytic function script.

## Usage
An analytic surface is created by supplying a Tcl proc named
"computeSurfacePoint" in a separate script file, which must accept two
numeric arguments (U, V), and return a point in 3-D space (represented
as a list in the form "$x $y $z").

An analytic curve is created by supplying a Tcl proc named
"computeSegmentPoint" in a separate script file, which must accept one
numeric argument (U), and return a point in 3-D space (represented as a
list in the form "$x $y $z").

The supplied script may include either or both of "computeSurfacePoint" and
"computeSegmentPoint".

## Limitations
The ability of this script to construct surfaces containing
discontinuities or sharp edges is limited. It is suggested to use two
functions to define such a surface. If a function that produces
discontinuities or sharp edges must be used, it is suggested that either
the U or V axis be aligned with the discontinuity or edge. As an example,
compare the results of absSphere.glf and absSphereV2.glf, or the results of
of discontinuitySphere.glf and discontinuitySphereV2.glf in the examples
folder.
